Breadth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
It starts at the tree root, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. 
It uses the opposite strategy of depth-first search, which instead explores the node branch as far as possible before being forced to backtrack and expand other nodes.


Month ago, i created package for develping Undirected Graph's environment. In this package, we have Graph class that defines Undirected Graph. And Paths superclass to find path from source vertice to destination vertice. And i already created DFS algorithm for this environment.And there is TestGraph class to test our graph with tinyG.txt file that used for input data about graph. I make diagram by using website https://www.diagrameditor.com/ and make screenshot. Below, you can see image of this diagram. I make this diagram by following tinyG.txt.
